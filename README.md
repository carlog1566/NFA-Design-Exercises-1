### 1) Which problem(s) gave you the most trouble? Did you avoid any problem that is too challenging to finish by deadline? Did you ask questions to AI/instructor?

The problem that gave me the most trouble was problem 16 because of how it was a little challenging to understand when we would accept or reject a string which caused me to get the accepting state wrong at first. I didn't try to avoid any problem that was too challenging to finish by the deadline. I did not ask questions to AI/instructor.

### 2) Which problem(s) surprised you with a "gold-st-ring"? Which next state(s) did you not account for in the subset of next states? why? How to make sure you avoid such errors in your future flight/traffic/compiler state controller tasks, or in the near future, the course projects/exams?

The problems that suprised me with a "gold-st-ring" was problem 16, 11, and 13. 

### 3) Other insights/comments/questions that you want the grader/instructor to know.
